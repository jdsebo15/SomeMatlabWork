# SomeMatlabWork
 THis is a model of a plug flow reactor i built in matlab. It's been a long time since i've ran this program, or even had matlab on my computer. One day i'll work back through this so that i'm familiar with and can speak to this program. 

 It was a final for a class i took in college called computer methods. It was basically my start in programming. It was a rather large group project that i practically completed by myself after my group couldn't debug the program any further.
